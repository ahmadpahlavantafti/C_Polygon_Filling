# C_Polygon_Filling
Polygon-fill implementation using C++ and OpenGL.
In this project, I was asked to implement a polygon-fill algorithm in OpenGL. 
The following specifications should be taken into consideration: 1) Should display 
everything in a window of 450 * 450 pixels. 2) Should also draw a polygon in this 
window using OpenGL function. I was given the mask, defined by nine blocks including 
one in red, one in green, one in blue, one in yellow, and five in white. The size of 
the mask is 90*90 pixels. This repository contains the source code (C++ & OpenGL).
